# Trebuchet Physics Principles (from Video Analysis)

## Core Mechanics
- **Energy conversion**: Potential energy of counterweight → Kinetic energy of projectile
- **Double pendulum effect**: Sling attached to throwing arm creates a whipping motion that multiplies projectile speed
- **Energy efficiency**: Typically 70-80% due to friction and retained energy in moving components

## Sling Behavior
- **Two-rope system**: One fixed rope + one looped over a release pin
- **Release mechanism**: Centrifugal force causes the loop to slide off the release pin during rotation
- **Critical parameter**: Release pin angle dramatically affects trajectory and accuracy

## Launch Phases
1. **Constrained motion**: Projectile moves on guide chute
2. **Unconstrained motion**: Sling lifts and swings freely
3. **Release**: Projectile separates from sling

## Optimal Parameters
- **Sling length**: Should equal throwing arm length
- **Arm ratio**: Throwing arm should be ~4x longer than counterweight arm
- **Mass ratio**: Counterweight should be ~100x heavier than projectile
- **Initial beam angle**: 45 degrees
- **Release angle**: 45 degrees to horizontal for maximum range

## Key Physics Constraints
- Release timing is critical - too early or too late reduces range
- Sling must maintain proper tension throughout swing
- Projectile must follow correct arc during all three phases
- Release pin angle determines when sling releases projectile

## Additional Physics Details (from Wikipedia)

### Beam and Sling Mechanics
- Beam rotates vertically through wide arc (typically over 180°)
- Sling rotates farther than beam (typically about 360°) and therefore faster
- Sling length increases mechanical advantage and changes trajectory
- Adjusting sling's release point is PRIMARY means of fine-tuning range
- Rotation speed increases smoothly, building up quickly from slow start

### Critical Design Ratios
- Projectile section of beam: 4-6x longer than force application section
- Beam can be as long as 15 meters (50 ft)

### Sling Release Mechanism
- Automatic release mechanism launches projectile at desired point of arm swing
- Release timing determines speed and angle at time of release
- Sling must release when projectile is traveling at desired speed and angle for target range

### Energy Transfer
- Force causes rotational acceleration around axle (fulcrum)
- Acceleration multiplied through beam length and sling
- Smooth acceleration and deceleration (unlike violent stops in other catapults)

### Key Physics Violations to Check
1. **Sling rotation**: Must rotate ~360° and exceed beam rotation
2. **Release timing**: Must occur at correct point in swing arc
3. **Velocity continuity**: Projectile velocity must be continuous through release
4. **Constraint forces**: Sling tension must remain positive (no slack)
5. **Angular constraints**: Release angle must match trajectory requirements
